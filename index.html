  <h1>Welcome to Prehistoric Paradise</h1>
  <h2>Where all your giant lizard dreams come true.</h2>

    <h3>We want everyone to have a roaring good time with our scaley
      friends!</h3>
    <p>Dinosaurs are neat and not slimey like many people think.
      They also probably won't eat you, because they are herbivores.
      You can pet our dinosaurs and ride them. You can even feed them
      snacks.
